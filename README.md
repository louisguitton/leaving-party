> I deeply respect people who have the courage to quit when they feel they have done what they wanted to do, expressed what they wanted to express, created what they wanted to create…quitting is rare. When people find something that "works" they usually keep producing content ad nauseam…We should celebrate more people who [quit]. It's not even quitting. It's called being done with something. And that's a good thing.
